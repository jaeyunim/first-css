    <h2>Galaxy S20</h2>
    <p>
      Samsung Galaxy S20 is a line of Android-based smartphones designed,
      developed, marketed, and manufactured by Samsung Electronics as part of
      its Galaxy S series.[2][3] They collectively serve as the successor to t
      he Galaxy S10 and were unveiled at Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event on
      11 February 2020.[4][5] The S20 line consists of flagship Galaxy S20
      and Galaxy S20+ models differentiated primarily by screen size, as well as
      a larger camera-focused model, the Galaxy S20 Ultra.[6] Key upgrades over
      the previous model, in addition to improved specifications, include a
      display with a 120 Hz refresh rate, an improved camera system supporting
      8K video recording (7680×4320) and a super-resolution zoom of 30–100×,
      depending on the model.[7]
