    <h2>Smart Phone</h2>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone" target="_blank">smartphone</a>
      is a mobile device that combines cellular and mobile computing
      functions into one unit. They are distinguished from feature phones by their
      stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems,
      which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing[1] over mobile
      broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming)
      <u>alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging.</u>
      Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS)
      integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged
      by their software (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer,
      gyroscope, or accelerometer), and support wireless communications protocols
      (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).

    <p>Improved hardware and faster wireless communication (due to standards such as LTE)
       have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry. In the third quarter of 2012,
       one billion smartphones were in use worldwide.[2] Global smartphone sales surpassed
       the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.[3]
